    the offset is distance from center of bed at which seed is planted. Keep 0 for 1 row."

    id: `${scope}.moduleMaskPattern`,
    defaultMessage: `A pattern of 110 will mean, to remove every third module.<br />
    A Pattern of 10 will mean to remove every second module.`,

  gapBetweenModules: {
    id: `${scope}.gapBetweenModules`,
    defaultMessage: `If not sure, default gap may be kept 25 mm.<br />
    Increasing this gap may increase sun penetration in your farm, but at the cost of a more expensive structure.`,

    id: `${scope}.pitchOfRow`,

  stretch: {
    id: `${cropScope}.stretch`,

  },
  interBed: {
    id: `${cropScope}.stretch`,
    defaultMessage: `Defines how multiple crops are arranged across beds. Each bed type is assigned a number, and the pattern (e.g., 001 for two of Bed 1 followed by one of Bed 2) determines how they repeat in the layout.`,

  startPointOffset: {
    id: `${cropScope}.startPointOffset`,
    defaultMessage: `Changing this offset changes how your beds are w.r.t modules above. If the offset equals bed spacing, the beds again come to same position. Hence maximum offset is bed c/c spacing.`,

    id: `${cropScope}.bedAzimuth`,
    defaultMessage: `"Along" implies your beds look parallel to your PV rows, if seen from above.<br />
    "Across" implies they are orthogonal`,
